[NetflixBot](http://reddit.com/user/netflixbot)
===============================

NetflixBot is designed to be a bot that listens to specific movie subreddits and when called upon (correctly) replies with whether a movie is currently streamable on Netflix (in the US). You can now also ask for a list of movies starring any actor or directed by any director on Netflix instant. 

## How to Call NetflixBot
Calling NetflixBot is simple, but if you enter an incorrect character (as of now) it may return inaccurate information, OR may not recognize a call. The proper call syntax is:

### Movies

For a single movie:

> /u/netflixbot movie1

For a list of movies:

> /u/netflixbot movie1,movie2,movie3

OR...

> /u/netflixbot movie1, movie2, movie3

If a title has comma in it, you should specify the title in quotes:

> /u/netflixbot Breaking Bad, "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels", Don Jon

### Directors

For a list of movies directed by a director:

> /u/netflixbot Director: Quentin Tarantino

### Actors

For a list of movies starring an actor:

> /u/netflixbot Actor: Bruce Willis

### Important Notes
* Currently only supports one type of call per comment (movie, actor or director)
* It must be "/u/netflixbot" with both '/'
* The call must be on its own line
* Capitlization does not matter
* Title must match exactly; this causes problems for some things like "The Office" which is "The Office (U.S.)" on Netflix
* There can be spaces between items in a list
* You can put any amount of text before the line where you call /u/netflixbot or after (careful of bullet 3)

## Current Subreddits
Currently testing on small subreddits...

* [/r/movies](http://reddit.com/r/movies)
* [/r/movieclub](http://reddit.com/r/movieclub)
* [/r/horror](http://reddit.com/r/horror)
* [/r/scifi](http://reddit.com/r/scifi)
* [/r/moviesuggestions](http://reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions)
* [/r/botwatch](http://reddit.com/r/botwatch)

*If you would like me to add your subreddit, please reach out to me.*

## How to Clone/Fork and Run NetflixBot
NetflixBot was written to run in Python 2.7 and you will need the following packages:
* PRAW (Reddit Python API)
* NetflixRouletteAPI

To install these, first install Python 2.7, then install PIP. This is simple so do the necessary searching. Then run the following commands:

> pip install praw


> pip install NetflixRouletteAPI

You will also need to edit the config.cfg file with your bots credentials. The code should now compile and run :)

## How Does the Code Work or How Do I Create a Bot?

Check out my Reddit PRAW tutorial [here](http://www.wrightlyso.com/blog/reddit-api-subreddit) and my Reddit bot tutorial [here](http://www.wrightlyso.com/blog/netflixbot-tutorial).

##Additional Notes
*Why is it US only? Reddit is an international community!*

Right now the NetflixRouletteAPI only supports the US, and since I use this API, I can currently only support US accuracy. If this bot becomes popular I would like to increase its scope.
